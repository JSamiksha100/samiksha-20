 <h2>IFrame </h2>
 <p>Frame ideas can be implanted in form of Inline Frames(Iframe),that allows you to open new pages inside main pages, Inline or “floating” frames are ones which appear on a page, much like an image or a table. This helps developers to open completely separate pages in the middle of your pages. Although Iframe can be placed anywhere in the document making it very flexible to use, HTML Iframe is useful when developers want to include one web page or document inside the current HTML document.
