 <h2>Browser Support for Frames </h2>
 <p>If a user is using any old browser or any browser, which does not support frames then noframes element should be displayed to the user.

So you must place a body element inside the noframes element because the frameset element is supposed to replace the bodyelement, but if a browser does not understand frameset element then it should understand what is inside the body element which is contained in a noframes element.</p>
